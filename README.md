# idl-guiS
Code to learn/practise my own IDL GUIs/widgets.

Eventually I want to make a GUI to select parameters to use with the cubegrim_vec.pro gridding code. 
This is where I will create and park .pro files that I find useful as I learn to make these widgets. 

# tab_gridwidget.pro

This is a prototype widget for taking inputs from a user that will be used with another 
piece of code. This facilitates user input to set parameters required and gives examples for 
how numerical inputs and radio buttons are used in such an application. COMMON statements 
pass the values and would be used to share the parameters with the main program.
